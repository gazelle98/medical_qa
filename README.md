Question Answering Dataset Generation in Medical Area
==============================
This project is a start for an automated question answering system in Persian medical area that uses Persian Wikipedia as its knowledge base. We extracted 1000 rows of Persian data relevant to medicine manually from Wikipedia and translated the [SQuAD dataset](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) to Persian. Both of these datasets are in my [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/gazelle98/datasets)
 We are going to extend our dataset and using [DrQA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DrQA) as our training model and process.
